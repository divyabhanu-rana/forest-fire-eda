## üìÑ Dataset Description

**Dataset Name:** Forest Fires Data Set  
**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
**URL:** [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires)  
**Format:** CSV (`forestfires.csv`)  
**Instances:** 517  
**Features:** 13

This dataset captures meteorological and fire-related attributes in the Montesinho natural park of Portugal. The main goal is to understand the environmental and human factors that influence the **severity and frequency** of forest fires.
